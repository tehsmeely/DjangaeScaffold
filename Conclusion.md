#Conclusion

I started this project new to Django and Google App Engine, so there has been a lot fo learning to do here.

With the benefit of hindsight, there are some things I think I would have done differently if starting again:

+ Class-based views - views.py is >1000 lines, I'm sure there is plenty that could be done with mixins etc, and so would be better off with Class based view functions
